- Added `readme.test.ts` to verify all code examples in README work correctly and pass type checking
- Exported `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` from `workflow-entry.ts` to match README imports
- Improved README structure with better concept pacing:
  - Introduced `run()` before `createWorkflow()` for gradual learning
  - Added "The Problem" and "Results as Data" sections for foundation
  - Added "The Composition Problem" to show pain before solution
  - Moved "How It Works" earlier in the document
  - Improved transitions and removed awkward phrasing
- Fixed em dashes to regular hyphens for consistency
