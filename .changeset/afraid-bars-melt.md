- **Docs (awaitly vs Effect)**: Rewrote intro and Quick Comparison for accuracy and tone. Narrowed overlap claim; added scope-of-comparison note; softened bundle and learning-curve wording; corrected error-typing (Effect generally inferred); clarified DI (explicit parameter vs Layers/Context); qualified circuit breaker/saga/durable/HITL as "not shipped as a core feature"; refined observability and resource rows; added per-run dependency injection note; reframed "What awaitly provides" as first-class modules; removed em dashes; aligned durable/HITL/circuit breaker prose.
- **Docs (Effect-style Layers in awaitly)**: Added workflow-factory pattern, lifecycle note, and "Day-to-day JavaScript ergonomics"; tightened intro and Aside; standardized "construct and execute" and terminology; added mental-model closing line.
