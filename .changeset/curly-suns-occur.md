- Add `awaitly/cache` memoization utilities and `awaitly/errors` prebuilt tagged error types.
- Expand workflow reliability + orchestration (rate limiting/concurrency helpers, improved caching/resume behavior, and workflow cancellation/hooks).
- Improve `awaitly-analyze` static analysis + Mermaid rendering, and extend `eslint-plugin-awaitly` with rules to prevent floating Results/workflows and require Result handling.
- Update docs for rate limiting, retries/timeouts, troubleshooting, and workflow comparisons.
