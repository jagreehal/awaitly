# eslint-plugin-awaitly

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cc6ebff: - Add browser-compatible static analysis via `awaitly-analyze/browser` (fetch-based WASM loading with configurable base path).
  - Improve static analysis coverage (detect `run()` calls, conditionals/loops/parallel/race patterns) and capture `createWorkflow` docs (`description`, `markdown`) for richer diagrams.
  - Add `eslint-plugin-awaitly` to catch common workflow mistakes (immediate execution, missing thunks for keyed steps, unstable cache keys).
  - Improve `awaitly` workflow DX: `STEP_TIMEOUT` is returned as a typed error (not wrapped) and workflows can include docs metadata for static analysis.
