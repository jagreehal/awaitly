# eslint-plugin-awaitly

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- c3a9f08: - **Docs (awaitly vs Effect)**: Rewrote intro and Quick Comparison for accuracy and tone. Narrowed overlap claim; added scope-of-comparison note; softened bundle and learning-curve wording; corrected error-typing (Effect generally inferred); clarified DI (explicit parameter vs Layers/Context); qualified circuit breaker/saga/durable/HITL as "not shipped as a core feature"; refined observability and resource rows; added per-run dependency injection note; reframed "What awaitly provides" as first-class modules; removed em dashes; aligned durable/HITL/circuit breaker prose.
  - **Docs (Effect-style Layers in awaitly)**: Added workflow-factory pattern, lifecycle note, and "Day-to-day JavaScript ergonomics"; tightened intro and Aside; standardized "construct and execute" and terminology; added mental-model closing line.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 98f110a: ### Effect-style step helpers

  - **step.run(id, result | getter, options?)** — Unwrap AsyncResult with step tracking. In createWorkflow, use a getter when using a key so cache hits don't run the operation.
  - **step.andThen(id, value, fn, options?)** — Chain from a success value into another AsyncResult-returning operation.
  - **step.match(id, result, { ok, err }, options?)** — Pattern match on Result with step tracking; now runs through the step engine (emits step_start/step_success, respects options).
  - **step.all(id, shape, options?)** — Alias for step.parallel; named parallel results. In createWorkflow, only caches when an explicit `key` is provided (no cache by step id when key omitted).
  - **step.map(id, items, mapper, options?)** — Parallel over array with step tracking. In createWorkflow, only caches when an explicit `key` is provided (no cache by step id when key omitted).

  All of these run through the full step engine (events, retry, timeout; in createWorkflow: cache and onAfterStep when key is used). API is aligned with Effect as close as possible while using async/await instead of generators.

  ### createWorkflow cache and lifecycle

  - **run, andThen, match, all, map** now route through the cached step wrapper so keyed calls use the workflow cache and onAfterStep (previously they bypassed the cache).
  - **step.run** accepts either a promise or a getter `() => AsyncResult`; use a getter when caching so the operation runs only on cache miss.
  - **step.all** and **step.map** only use the cache when you pass `{ key: '...' }`; omitted key means no cache (matches core run() semantics).

  ### eslint-plugin-awaitly

  - **require-step-id:** Enforces string literal first argument for step.run, step.andThen, step.match, step.all, step.map.
  - **no-floating-result:** Flags discarded results from step.run, step.andThen, step.match, step.all, step.map.
  - **no-immediate-execution:** step.run(id, promise) reported; autofix wraps in getter. Id-first step helpers (e.g. step.retry('id', fn)) now use second argument as executor for checking.
  - **require-thunk-for-key:** step.run with key requires getter (second argument) so cache hits don't run the operation.
  - README and rule docs updated to list the new helpers.

  ### Docs and skills

  - **Docs site:** Foundations (step.mdx) Effect-style ergonomics section; guides (caching, migration); comparison (awaitly-vs-effect) expanded with side-by-side Effect-style helpers; patterns (parallel-operations); reference (quick-reference); control-flow.
  - **Comparison:** "As close as we can get while still using async/await and not generators" messaging.
  - **.claude/skills/awaitly-patterns:** Step helpers table and concurrency section updated; Effect-style paragraph and caching semantics; options table; disallowed entry for step.run with key without getter.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 34022b8: - **Workflow naming:** `createWorkflow` now takes a required workflow name as the first argument (e.g. `createWorkflow('checkout', deps, options)`). The name is used in visualization, static analysis, and error messages.
  - **Docs:** Updated error-handling, ESLint plugin, functional utilities, visualization, parallel operations, and quick reference to use the new signature and to document event capture and library workflow options.
  - **awaitly-visualizer:** Added `event-capture` test suite and kitchen-sink workflow for event-to-IR and visualization pipelines.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6119f95: Saga step names: require a string name as the first argument to `saga.step()` and `saga.tryStep()` for observability and compensation tracking. Runtime validation rejects empty or non-string names with clear errors. ESLint rule `require-step-id` and static analyzer updated to enforce and analyze step names.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- afc8f6c: Documentation updates, static analyzer improvements, visualizer and ESLint plugin updates, and dependency bumps across packages.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1830163: **Step IDs for workflows and steps**

  - **awaitly**: Workflow execution and snapshots now use explicit step IDs. Steps and helpers (`step()`, `step.sleep()`, `step.retry()`, `step.withTimeout()`, `step.try()`, `step.fromResult()`) accept an optional string literal as the first argument for durable execution, resumption, and observability.
  - **eslint-plugin-awaitly**: New rule `require-step-id` enforces that all step calls use a string literal step ID as the first argument.
  - **awaitly-analyze**: Static workflow IR and analyzer updated to support step IDs.
  - **awaitly-visualizer**: IR builder updated for step ID support.
  - **awaitly-postgres**, **awaitly-mongo**, **awaitly-libsql**: README and docs updated for step IDs.
  - **awaitly-docs**: Documentation updated across foundations, guides, and reference for step IDs and the new ESLint rule.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f5957ad: Persistence DX: improved snapshot store APIs, Postgres/Mongo/LibSQL adapter consistency, and updated persistence docs and API reference.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f2ff00: Split `run()` function into separate entry point (`awaitly/run`) for better tree-shaking and bundle size optimization. The main `awaitly` package now exports only Result types and utilities, while `run()` and its related types (`RunStep`, `RunOptions`, `StepTimeoutError`, etc.) are available via `awaitly/run`. This allows users who only need Result types to import a smaller bundle without the step orchestration overhead.

  **What changed:**

  - `run()` is now available from `awaitly/run` entry point
  - Main `awaitly` entry point no longer exports `run()` (only Result types)
  - Related types (`RunStep`, `RunOptions`, `StepTimeoutError`, etc.) moved to `awaitly/run`
  - Documentation updated to reflect new import paths

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { run } from "awaitly";

  // After (recommended)
  import { run } from "awaitly/run";
  import { ok, err, type AsyncResult } from "awaitly";

  // Or import both from their respective entry points
  import { run, type RunStep } from "awaitly/run";
  import { ok, err } from "awaitly";
  ```

  This change improves bundle size for users who only need Result types, while keeping `run()` easily accessible for those who need step-based composition.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e9396f1: ### New Features

  - **Persistence Adapters**: Added `awaitly-mongo` and `awaitly-postgres` packages for MongoDB and PostgreSQL persistence with automatic schema creation, TTL support, and connection pooling
  - **Functional Utilities**: New `awaitly/functional` entry point with Effect-inspired utilities including `pipe`, `map`, `flatMap`, `match`, and collection combinators for Result type composition
  - **ESLint Rule**: Added `no-double-wrap-result` rule to detect and prevent double-wrapping Result types in workflow executors

  ### Improvements

  - Enhanced static analyzer with improved workflow detection and analysis
  - Expanded documentation with guides for MongoDB/PostgreSQL persistence, functional utilities, and AI integration patterns

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b589cb2: Add comprehensive documentation for `bindDeps` utility

  - Added `bindDeps` to API reference with usage examples
  - Created new "Dependency Binding" guide covering the `fn(args, deps)` pattern
  - Added guide to navigation sidebar
  - Includes examples for Express, React, Next.js integration
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.astro/` build directory

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e439143: - Add `awaitly/cache` memoization utilities and `awaitly/errors` prebuilt tagged error types.
  - Expand workflow reliability + orchestration (rate limiting/concurrency helpers, improved caching/resume behavior, and workflow cancellation/hooks).
  - Improve `awaitly-analyze` static analysis + Mermaid rendering, and extend `eslint-plugin-awaitly` with rules to prevent floating Results/workflows and require Result handling.
  - Update docs for rate limiting, retries/timeouts, troubleshooting, and workflow comparisons.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cc6ebff: - Add browser-compatible static analysis via `awaitly-analyze/browser` (fetch-based WASM loading with configurable base path).
  - Improve static analysis coverage (detect `run()` calls, conditionals/loops/parallel/race patterns) and capture `createWorkflow` docs (`description`, `markdown`) for richer diagrams.
  - Add `eslint-plugin-awaitly` to catch common workflow mistakes (immediate execution, missing thunks for keyed steps, unstable cache keys).
  - Improve `awaitly` workflow DX: `STEP_TIMEOUT` is returned as a typed error (not wrapped) and workflows can include docs metadata for static analysis.
