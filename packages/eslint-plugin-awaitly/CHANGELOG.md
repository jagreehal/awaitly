# eslint-plugin-awaitly

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e9396f1: ### New Features

  - **Persistence Adapters**: Added `awaitly-mongo` and `awaitly-postgres` packages for MongoDB and PostgreSQL persistence with automatic schema creation, TTL support, and connection pooling
  - **Functional Utilities**: New `awaitly/functional` entry point with Effect-inspired utilities including `pipe`, `map`, `flatMap`, `match`, and collection combinators for Result type composition
  - **ESLint Rule**: Added `no-double-wrap-result` rule to detect and prevent double-wrapping Result types in workflow executors

  ### Improvements

  - Enhanced static analyzer with improved workflow detection and analysis
  - Expanded documentation with guides for MongoDB/PostgreSQL persistence, functional utilities, and AI integration patterns

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b589cb2: Add comprehensive documentation for `bindDeps` utility

  - Added `bindDeps` to API reference with usage examples
  - Created new "Dependency Binding" guide covering the `fn(args, deps)` pattern
  - Added guide to navigation sidebar
  - Includes examples for Express, React, Next.js integration
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.astro/` build directory

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e439143: - Add `awaitly/cache` memoization utilities and `awaitly/errors` prebuilt tagged error types.
  - Expand workflow reliability + orchestration (rate limiting/concurrency helpers, improved caching/resume behavior, and workflow cancellation/hooks).
  - Improve `awaitly-analyze` static analysis + Mermaid rendering, and extend `eslint-plugin-awaitly` with rules to prevent floating Results/workflows and require Result handling.
  - Update docs for rate limiting, retries/timeouts, troubleshooting, and workflow comparisons.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cc6ebff: - Add browser-compatible static analysis via `awaitly-analyze/browser` (fetch-based WASM loading with configurable base path).
  - Improve static analysis coverage (detect `run()` calls, conditionals/loops/parallel/race patterns) and capture `createWorkflow` docs (`description`, `markdown`) for richer diagrams.
  - Add `eslint-plugin-awaitly` to catch common workflow mistakes (immediate execution, missing thunks for keyed steps, unstable cache keys).
  - Improve `awaitly` workflow DX: `STEP_TIMEOUT` is returned as a typed error (not wrapped) and workflows can include docs metadata for static analysis.
