import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## What it does

- Wraps async operations in `Result<T, E>` instead of try/catch
- Infers error types from your dependencies automatically
- Provides step caching, retries, and timeouts when you need them
- Supports pause/resume for long-running workflows

## Install

```bash
npm install @jagreehal/workflow
```

## Basic example

```typescript
import { createWorkflow, ok, err, type AsyncResult } from '@jagreehal/workflow';

// Define operations that return Results
const fetchUser = async (id: string): AsyncResult<User, 'NOT_FOUND'> =>
  id === '1' ? ok({ id, name: 'Alice' }) : err('NOT_FOUND');

// Create workflow - error types are inferred
const workflow = createWorkflow({ fetchUser });

// Run it
const result = await workflow(async (step) => {
  const user = await step(fetchUser('1'));
  return user;
});

if (result.ok) {
  console.log(result.value.name);
} else {
  // TypeScript knows: result.error is 'NOT_FOUND' | UnexpectedError
}
```

## When to use this

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Typed errors with async/await" icon="pencil">
    You want compile-time error checking without giving up familiar syntax
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reliability primitives" icon="setting">
    You need retries, timeouts, circuit breakers built into your workflow
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-running workflows" icon="document">
    You're building workflows that pause for approval or persist across restarts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic error inference" icon="approve-check">
    You want error types computed from dependencies, not maintained manually
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## When not to use this

- **Simple scripts** - If you don't need typed errors, try/catch works fine
- **Functional chaining preferred** - If you prefer `.andThen()` chains, consider [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow)
- **Bundle size critical** - If you only need Result types without workflow features, a smaller library may suffice
